### Week 5 ###

## Oops I overwhelmed myself with an extra projects ##

In all the excitement of being at Berkeley, I manifested a project that would allow me to : 
1. Code an avatar to speak
2. Use technology for Learning History, specifically Black History.
3. Be engaged in activity that merges creativity and new media.

   Who knew being suscribed to a _random_ listserv could manifest dreams to come true!
   
   I applied and met with the team and they were lovely enough to onboard me with enthusiam. 

### Project Scope : 
For the George Moses Horton Project our goal was to prepare for a teach-in happening October 18th
I had three weeks to comb through a python code (which essentially became a crash course on coding and CS) 
The previous code was missing core elements, and I wasn't entirely sure the project was viable within the time frame
The team also never saw it work live. 

## Speculations: 
Because I am interested in immersive design, I figured this will be the first part in a journey towards creating an immersive exhibition of 
learning history in novel ways.
