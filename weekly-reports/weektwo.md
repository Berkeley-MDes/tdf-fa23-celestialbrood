## Maria's Week 2!  
### Reflections: 
  I am sooo excited because Rhino and Grasshopper work on my other laptop! I got to tinker around with Grasshopper and making adjustments
I am still wrapping my brain around the subtraction to create negative spaces but I think the more I practice this week I'll get the hang of it. 
I have yet to print, but that is a goal by for next week.


Since getting settled in from my grandmother's passing and funeral last week, 
I have been catching up on the rhino and grasshopper tutorials. 
I'm really intrigued by modeling logic, in this form it is a new concept for me. 
but I learned that 
_components = commands i.e = generate a circle_

I also figured out the markdown! I'm very proud of myself for that. 




### **Assessment of my work so far:**
_sigh_ I wish I was where my classmates are. Though I am proud of taking the steps to catch up, 
I am working to be gentle with myself because I'm also a single parent and caretaker to my aging mom. 
We're dealing with the consequences of uprooting my family from Socal. 
Transition is challenging but I am motivated and I see the progress! 





### Speculations: 
I feel like it is important to reflect internally for the sake of other poc students who come from different backgrounds, especially those of our peers.
