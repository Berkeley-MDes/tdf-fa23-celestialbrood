The Acorn Playhouse for Indigenous Storytelling by Maria-Teresa Carmier Villalobos

SUMMARY:
In celebration of Native American Heritage Month, the "Acorn House" project aims to pay tribute to Indigenous culture and heritage by utilizing a staple of the Indigenous diet in a creative and culturally meaningful way. The project's goal is to construct a quaint acorn-themed playhouse that not only serves as an engaging play space but also serves as a medium for storytelling, cultural enrichment, and education. This unique project merges Indigenous traditions, technology applications, and immersive play scenarios.

RESEARCH PLAN:
To achieve the project's goal, a series of exploratory technology experiments and research activities have begun: 
1. Researching and gathering information on Indigenous cultures, particularly their use of acorns as a dietary staple and its cultural significance.
2. Experiment with Grasshopper in Rhino to design the acorn-shaped structure while respecting Indigenous design aesthetics.
3. Explore crafting techniques, including using sustainable materials and Indigenous-inspired artwork, to create the playhouse.
4. Develop interactive storytelling elements rooted in Indigenous narratives and heritage, ensuring cultural authenticity and respect.

CURRENT WORK:
The project has commenced with initial research into mine and other Indigenous cultures and their use of acorns, as well as preliminary rhino design experiments. During this phase, it became apparent that constructing a full-fledged wooden house, while aesthetically appealing, may not be the most feasible approach due to time constraints and logistical considerations.

In light of this, I decided to adopt a more agile and scalable approach. Instead of a traditional wooden construction, I’d like to explore the use of laser-cut cardboard as the primary material for building. This decision offers several advantages, including faster iteration, scalability, and movability.

MOTIVATION:
The core learning goals of this project are to:
- Foster a deeper understanding and appreciation of Indigenous cultures and their contributions to society.
- Apply technology, design, and craftsmanship to create an immersive and respectful representation of Indigenous heritage.
- Promote storytelling as a powerful tool for cultural preservation and education.
- Engage children in a playful, educational, and culturally enriching environment that encourages respect and understanding of the diversity within Indigenous people’s culture and traditions.

CHALLENGE LEVEL:
The project's challenge level is Platypus, indicating moderate complexity, as it involves design, craftsmanship, and cultural sensitivity, ensuring an engaging but manageable challenge.

TIMELINE:
The project timeline for the Acorn House for Indigenous Storytelling is as follows:
- November 16: Proof of concept(s) - Finalize Grasshopper design, gather cultural insights, and begin crafting prototypes.
- November 30: Working prototype(s)/demonstrations - Refine design, collaborate with Indigenous communities, and continue construction of the Acorn House.
- December 4: Practice presentation for Jacobs Design Showcase - Prepare a presentation showcasing the project's cultural significance, design, and progress made to date, emphasizing the educational and storytelling aspects.
