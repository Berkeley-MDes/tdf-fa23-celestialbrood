## Project 2 Updates

# Reflections 
This week was interesting to start a new project where we're focusing on using the particle photon 2 to initiate complex operations using mechanical and electrical components. I joined the Mindful Meditations group. During this week's lecture, we heard from a person involved with the company Particle who shared with us insight on the flexibility of programming with 
photons. 
 
I was tasked with the mechanical portion of the project after prototyping the movement

I took the adafruit servo apart to understand the mechanism of its turning. I tried researching how to connect the photon2 to the servo but realized I was missing 
the sparcfun quick connect which I missed getting the week prior.

I instead decided to tinker with sensors and created a motion sensor from the particle tutorials. 

# Speculations 
Once getting the sparcfun I can activate the servo to move and delegate the degrees it should turn.
