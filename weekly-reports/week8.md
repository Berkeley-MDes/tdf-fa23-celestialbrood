## Project 2 Updates

# Reflections 
This week was interesting to start a new project where we're focusing on using the particle photon 2 to initiate complex operations using mechanical and electrical components. I joined the Mindful Meditations group. During this week's lecture, we heard from a person involved with the company Particle who shared with us insight on the flexibility of programming with 
photons. 
 
I was tasked with the mechanical portion of the project after prototyping the movement

I took the adafruit servo apart to understand the mechanism of its turning. I tried researching how to connect the photon2 to the servo but realized I was missing 
the sparcfun quick connect which I missed getting the week prior.

I instead decided to tinker with sensors and created a motion sensor from the particle tutorials. 

# Speculations 
Once getting the sparcfun I can activate the servo to move and delegate the degrees it should turn.

I reached out to Roland this week to discuss managing professors' expectations with my ability. He helped put things in perspective like how sometimes we all come from different backgrounds and many times, we're the only creative minority and when we get here to Berkeley, that is no longer the case. I am struggling but I am grateful for classes like TDF because even though the material is new and challenging the team is accessible and eager to support especially in places with one doesn't understand. Group dynamics are hard and I am working to navigate them, even if it is a lonely venture, there are folks who've been in the trenches to and that helps to see things from the other side.
