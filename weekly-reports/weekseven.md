## Project 2 Specs: 

ðŸª·TDF Mindful Meditation Bloom 
Project Overview
Meditation Bloom aims to amalgamate technology, aesthetic, and mindfulness, crafting a transformative physical and mental experience. It is a meditation-assistive device that provides a multi-sensory experience by integrating visual, tactile, and audial cues, thus enhancing the user's focus and immersion during the meditation process.


Components:
1. Meditation Flower:
Function: 
Opens and closes in synchronization with the prescribed meditation breathing pattern.

Design: 
Resembling a delicate flower that blooms and retreats, providing a visually calming and metaphorically rich imagery.

Technology:
Utilizes mechanical petals that are controlled by a microcontroller, ensuring smooth and synchronized movement.

Lighting:
Subtle and adjustable lighting that complements meditation moods and provides ambience.

2. Wristband
Function: 
Vibrates subtly, aligning with the meditation breathing pace and providing tactile feedback for breathing synchronization.

Design: 
Ergonomic, lightweight, and non-intrusive, ensuring comfort and aesthetic appeal.

Technology:
Employs a precision haptic motor which can adjust vibration intensity and pattern, to avoid startling the user and to align accurately with the meditation rhythm.
Target Audience
Primary:
Individuals seeking innovative and immersive meditation experiences.

Secondary:
Wellness centers, therapists, and yoga studios that could utilize the device to enhance their service offering.
User Interaction
The user initiates a meditation session via a mobile application, selecting or customizing their breathing pattern and pace.
The Meditation Flower responds by opening and closing in tandem with the selected breathing pattern, while simultaneously illuminating to establish a serene environment.
The wristband vibrates in sync with the pattern, providing tactile cues to assist the user in maintaining the prescribed breathing rhythm.

Objectives
Enhance the userâ€™s meditation experience through multi-sensory engagement.
Provide a visually pleasing apparatus that doubles as a decorative piece when not in use.
Facilitate consistent and focused meditation through synchronized cues.

Key Features
Breathing Flower:
The Meditation Flower is able to close and open up based on selected meditation patterns with a built-in lighting that is capable of changing colors according to the userâ€™s selection.

Vibrating Wristband:
The wristband vibrates subtly on the userâ€™s wristband according to the selected meditation patterns.

Synchronization:
Ensures that visual and tactile cues are precisely synchronized with the selected meditation pattern.

User Customization:
Allows the user to select and customize breathing patterns, vibration intensity, and light intensity.

App Integration: 
(Might now able to realize in this round of iteration, but is open up to further development)
Enables the user to control, customize, and track their meditation sessions via a dedicated app.

Design Specification
Technological Challenges:
A smooth mechanism for the Meditation Bloom to open and close up.
Robust and quiet motor for the Meditation Bloom to ensure non-disruptive drive of the mechanical part.
A reliable communication protocol between the Meditation Flower, wristband, and app, ensuring synchronized operation.
High-precision haptic technology in the wristband for subtle and accurate vibrations.
Energy-efficient LED technology for the Meditation Flower, ensuring sustainable operation and longevity.

Circuits & Code


In terms of the coding, we plan to rely on the rotating servo motor to control the mechanical parts to mimic the flower opening and closing.

Wristband

ðŸ¤–Mechanical
A simple wristband can be done through laser cutting plywood and bend it in shape: living hinge template


ðŸ‘¾Circuits & Code
For the wristband, it has a vibrator motor built inside for vibration guiding on the wrist. The vibration pace will be in sync with the motion of the flower, working as a secondary guide device for meditation.

The circuit (and code) of the wristband is quite straightforward: by connecting vibrator motor to photon 2 and set the pace to link to the meditation pace. For the code, we can build a front-end web page that has several buttons on it. By controlling the buttons users will be able to test, begin or end the vibration.
