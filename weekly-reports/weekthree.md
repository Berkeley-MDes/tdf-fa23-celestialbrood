## Week 3 ##

I feel like the more vulnerable you are with your self, the more reflective you become publicly, it can be used against you. People may not like my pessimism, but
it does nothing for me to hold it in and acknowledge it outloud for the hope of being wrong. I really hope I am wrong much of the time!

The beginning of the course I wrestled with and succumb to the enchantment of imposter syndrome. It's a deadly faulty case that can hinder one's progress. 
I think the professors, speakers, and GSIs have done an incredible job of holding my hand through this process and allowing me to fall, make mistakes
witness my errors non-judgementally AND generously help me think to reconvene for optimial landing. 

# Speculations #
I suspect that I will continue to use this space to reflect publicly about my triumphs.
