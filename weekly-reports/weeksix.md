## Week Six (Absolute Chaos but FUN) 

Hello! 
This week has been exciting, I've struggled my ass off making this LED light blink with the Photon. 

But alas success!!!!

I felt like Beyonce of Technology making it Blink tbh.

## Speculations: 

I was asked to join another project that incorporates VR/AR experiences for an African-American History Exhibition here at Berkeley, this week's classes made me reflect on on the
possibilities of creating tangible user experiences that incorporate VR. Speaking to Dr. Cecil and Dr.Chris from the English Departments made me also think about my 
experiences at the Civil Rights Museum in Memphis, TN. I want to create projects similarly that bridge history and technology. 
One specific exhibit used sounds of the ocean, crying, and whipped lashes as you step onto a boat that 
shows very visibly what the slave life was like during the trip across the sea. 

## Black Parent Innovation Lab

I was selected to join a competitive Black Parenting Innovation lab that asks us to brainstorm solutions for our community. I asked two broad questions: 
# How can I empower aunties, uncles, neighbors, tios, and tias to not just care for their kids but mine too? 
  Working-class folks do not have the luxury to be focused on the grand scheme of things. As a person moving from poverty both financially and mentally, I 
  have come to have a deep respect and appreciation for the sacrifices my parents made to get me here. I have time to focus on inequality. I don't know if I can solve the problem of asking others to _care_ as much as I do AND have the time to. I realized as a first-generation student, I am the first to be able to pause and reflect. That was a big emotional revelation. 
  Over the weekend, I was also suggested to (lovingly), not to let the oppressor off the hook and be overwhelmed by wanting change. It is not impossible for change to happen and one small ripple makes a difference. You can plant the seed. They asked me what was doable now. 
  ### My second question: How can I create communities of unschooling?

  This was my doable question and I don't really have an answer yet. 

  ### Future possibilities : 

  As I continue to integrate all that I've learned, it makes me think about how to connect this larger community question to Black History and Technology. 

  I'm also working on a second project that situates AR/VR in Black Studies. I'm curious to understand more about emergent technologies and how we can use them to create novel learning opportunities for k12 students and extend History lessons beyond paper.
