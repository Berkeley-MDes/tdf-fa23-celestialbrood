## Maria's Week 3-4!  
### Reflections: 
  Getting Rhino on my laptop was great, but I spent the last two weeks going deep* into tutorials 


### **Assessment of my work so far:**
I struggled to make sense of the spatial awareness of programming forms within grasshopper and then
seeing it applied in Rhino. But In reflection, I believe that where I was struggling was with internal skews instead
of logical use of the program. In other words, I got in my own way, making it difficult to move forward. 

As an artist, this type of mechanical practice logic is not yet innate. When making new work, 
I function with a healthy* amount of grandeur and learning a new tool I realize is going 
to take much more practice! I am excited to become one with the machine, as I am with the paint brush. 

My two sons and I spend a large amount of time doing 
homework around each other and I overheard one of them saying positive things to themselves about
getting through a tricky algebra problem. It was a proud mama moment and a reminder that my kiddos are "watching"
how I deal with difficult things, and this was no different than any other time. Which encouraged me to 
continue working at the challenges. 

I know these reflections get a little autoethnographic but I promise it has meaning to the process! 
I came upon this article from another class that discussed Afro-Latina perspective in Design, if you're a believer in 
magical things, it was quite serendipitous mapping out some of the emotional aspects of shifting one's path toward 
academic pursits. So it feels right to document the emotional aspect of my journey.

Where I struggled to make sense of the negative space of the cell phone design, I decided to break down forms 
to get a better understanding of three goals :
1. How to program forms in grasshopper
2.  understand how the xyz planes work 
3. create a form

   Answering the above:
   1. I had the question why use grasshopper at all? Creating forms in grasshoppers allows designers a different mode of creating forms. It gives
      the designer new capabilites of creating without the friction of static forms already in rhino.

      2. My next question required me to reflect on the mathematical components of space. I remeber as kid being
        like I'll probably never use this again, when even as an artist, numerical and geometric sense has never
        left my practice! It was cool to also show my kids that, I'm still using some math today.
      X Y Z axes help deliver precision for programming models, In rhino, we can see what we've programmed in these
      planes.

  
       I struggled with understanding where to place points within both grasshopper and rhino.
      One tutorial I found gave me the option to use the box vector. but in plugging in points, I only got a square.
      I struggled to understand how the z plane worked and connecting it to creating points in grasshopper.
      Once tinkering around, I realized that square forms didn't need three points but two. on the xy axis and then in the z.
      I assumed each point needed to be separate when using the box parameter.  

3. My end goal was to create the base of the cellphone design which resulted in a cube/box shape. 


### Speculations: 

I went to an New media talk with Artist-Professor from my alma mater UCI where he showed some of his work called
marching cubes, and 3-d printed the figures from the algorithim to create an interactive and immersive experience for
musuem goers to experience algorithims tangiably. 

# Marching Cubes as told by Chatgpt : 

Marching Cubes is an algorithm in computer graphics to extract a polygonal mesh of an isosurface from a three-dimensional scalar field. It was first described by Lorensen and Cline in a 1987 paper.

## Algorithm Description

The algorithm involves dividing the 3D space into a grid and examining each cube formed by the grid. Each cube is then classified based on the values of its vertices, and a corresponding polygonal surface is generated.

## History

The Marching Cubes algorithm was introduced by William E. Lorensen and Harvey E. Cline in their seminal paper titled "Marching Cubes: A High-Resolution 3D Surface Construction Algorithm."

## Applications

The Marching Cubes algorithm has found applications in various fields, including medical imaging, computer-aided design, scientific visualization, and more.

## Speculating : 
It was an interesting experience to see the use of grasshopper programming to be the base of a larger experiential 
project. I think this helped put into perspective the possibilities of creating and how art practice 
can transcend media. It also helped me see a real life use case of using these programming that connected 
to some personal experiences.
