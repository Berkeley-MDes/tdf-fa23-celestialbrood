# Project Proposal for Immersive Storytelling: Enchanted Pages
### By Maria-Teresa Carmier Villalobos

## Summary
"Enchanted Pages" is a proposed interactive exhibit for a children's museum, designed to transform a beloved children's story into an immersive, technology-driven experience. By integrating LLM AI with responsive sensors and digital fabrication, this exhibit will allow children to step into the world of the narrative, interacting with the story's environment and characters as if they were part of the tale themselves.

## Research Plan
The research will focus on:
- **Literary Analysis:** Selecting a popular children's story and analyzing its key components for immersive adaptation.
- **LLM AI Customization:** Tailoring an LLM AI to the chosen story enables it to generate narrative content and responses in its style.
- **Sensor Deployment:** Identifying the most effective sensors for capturing the children's interactions and responses during the exhibit.
- **Digital Fabrication Design:** Creating and printing physical artifacts from the story using digital fabrication to enhance the tangible experience of the narrative.

## Current Work
A preliminary framework has been set up to:
- Identify the story's narrative paths that participants can dynamically influence.
- Implement a basic LLM AI model for story dialogue and character interactions.

The next phase will include:
- Integrating various sensors (touch, sound, motion) to make the story respond to the children's actions.
- Developing prototypes for key story-based artifacts using digital fabrication methods.

## Motivation
The goals for "Enchanted Pages" are to:
- Foster children's love for reading and storytelling through interactive play.
- Demonstrate innovative uses of technology in an educational, museum-based setting.

This exhibit will not only promote literacy and engagement with classic stories but also serve as a model for the fusion of traditional storytelling with modern technology.

## Challenge Level
Considering the target audience's age and the complexity of creating an interactive narrative environment, this project is rated at the "Axolotl" level.

## Timeline
- **Week 1 (November 13 - November 19):** Finalize the selection of the children’s story. Start developing the LLM AI to understand and interact within the narrative framework of the story.
- **Week 2 (November 20 - November 26):** Design the interaction model using sensors that will allow children to engage with the story. Begin creating digital blueprints for the physical artifacts that will feature in the exhibit.
- **Week 3 (November 27 - December 3):** Complete the development of the interactive script and dialogues using the LLM AI. Produce the first prototypes of digitally fabricated artifacts for the exhibit.
- **Week 4 (December 4 - December 6):** Conduct initial integration tests of the sensors with the LLM AI-driven narrative. Make necessary refinements to the digital fabrication artifacts. Begin assembling the exhibit.
- **December 7th:** Present "Enchanted Pages" at the children’s museum, showcasing a fully interactive and immersive storytelling experience.
